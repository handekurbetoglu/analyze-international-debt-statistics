# Analysis of The World Bank's International Debt Data

## Introduction
This notebook explores the international debt data provided by The World Bank. It focuses on understanding the impact of debts on the economies of various countries, particularly developing ones. The data includes information on different types of debts owed by countries, and through our analysis, we aim to uncover insights into economic dependencies and financial burdens faced by these nations.

## Data Source

## Questions Addressed
	What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
	Which country has the maximum amount of debt, and what is the magnitude of this debt?
	What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## SQL Queries
The analysis is performed using SQL queries executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment, allowing for an interactive exploration of the data. Key queries include:
	
	Retrieving basic data on debts.
	Counting distinct countries to gauge the breadth of data.
	Summarizing total debts and identifying countries with the highest financial dues.

## Key Findings
